# Folder Structure Suggestions

This document outlines suggestions for improving the project's folder structure to enhance maintainability, clarity, and adherence to best practices.

## I. Core Application Structure (`src/app`)

### `src/app/common` Folder (Primary Area for Improvement)

This folder is currently a large catch-all. While it's good to have a place for truly shared code, its current breadth can lead to disorganization.

*   **Suggestion 1: Feature-Specific vs. Truly Common:**
    *   **Action:** Review every item within `src/app/common` (components, controllers, directives, helpers, interceptors, interfaces, models, pipes, services). If a component, directive, pipe, or service is *only* used by one specific feature module (e.g., `canvas-workspace` component if only used by `canvas-generator` module, or `district.service` if only used by a `data-management` feature), move it *into* that feature module's folder. This improves encapsulation and reduces the "common" burden.
    *   **Example:** If `canvas-workspace` is only for `canvas-generator`, move `src/app/common/component/canvas-workspace` to `src/app/module/canvas-generator/components/canvas-workspace`.

*   **Suggestion 2: Granular `common` Subfolders:**
    *   **Action:** For items that *are* truly common but belong to different domains, consider more specific subfolders within `common`. Instead of one massive `src/app/common/services` folder, you could have `src/app/common/services/auth`, `src/app/common/services/data`, `src/app/common/services/ui`, etc. This applies to `directives` and `components` as well if they remain in `common`.

*   **Suggestion 3: `commonInterfaces.ts`:**
    *   **Action:** Break `commonInterfaces.ts` into more specific interface files (e.g., `user.interface.ts`, `data.interface.ts`) and place them logically, either in `src/app/common/interfaces` or within relevant feature modules.

### `src/app/module` Folder

*   **Good:** The use of feature modules (e.g., `admin`, `dashboard`, `home`) is excellent.
*   **Suggestion:** Ensure consistency. Each feature module should ideally contain its own components, services, directives, and pipes that are specific to that feature, rather than relying solely on the `common` folder.

### `src/app/graphql` Folder

*   **Good:** This is well-organized for GraphQL-related files.

### `src/app/layout` Folder

*   **Good:** Clear separation for different layout types.

## II. Assets and Static Files (`src/assets`)

### `src/assets/fonts`

*   **Suggestion 4: Clean Up Fonts:**
    *   **Action:** This folder contains zipped font files (`font-icons-v1.0.zip`) and many subfolders. Unzip necessary fonts and organize them directly. Remove any unused or redundant font files/folders. Consider if all these fonts are actually used and if some could be loaded via CDN (e.g., Google Fonts) to reduce bundle size.

### `src/assets/js/masonry.js`

*   **Suggestion 5: Manage Third-Party JS:**
    *   **Action:** If `masonry.js` is a third-party library, it's generally better to install it via npm (`npm install masonry-layout`) and import it directly into the Angular component or service that uses it. Remove `masonry.js` from `assets` and manage it as an npm dependency. This allows for better version control, updates, and tree-shaking.

## III. Root Level & Miscellaneous Files

*   **`app.zip` and `graphql.zip` (inside `src/app`)**:
    *   **Mistake 6: Remove Zipped Files from Source:**
        *   **Action:** Zipped files should *never* be part of your active source code. They bloat the repository, cause confusion, and are not managed by version control effectively. Delete `src/app/app.zip` and `src/app/graphql.zip`. If these are backups, use Git for version control or store them outside the project's working directory.

*   **`colorthief.d.ts` and `typings.d.ts`:**
    *   **Suggestion 7: Centralize Custom Typings:**
        *   **Action:** While `typings.d.ts` is a common place for global type declarations, `colorthief.d.ts` could be moved into a dedicated `src/typings` folder if you anticipate more custom type definitions. Create `src/typings` and move `colorthief.d.ts` there. Ensure `tsconfig.json` includes this new path.

*   **`SRS.md`:**
    *   **Suggestion 8: Documentation Folder:**
        *   **Action:** If you have multiple documentation files, consider creating a `docs/` folder at the project root to keep them organized. Create a `docs/` folder and move `SRS.md` into it.
