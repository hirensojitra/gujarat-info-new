Design a user interface (UI) for a 'Poster Design' page. Your design should prioritize an intuitive and efficient user experience for both novice and experienced users. Include the following sections and detailed considerations:

Overall Layout & Structure:

Describe the main layout sections (e.g., top bar, left/right panels, central canvas).

Detail the purpose and typical content of each section.

Specify how responsiveness will be handled across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet).

Explain the use of grid systems or spacing principles.

Top Menu/Header Bar:

What core actions and indicators will be present (e.g., project name, save status, undo/redo, share, download/export options, user profile)?

How will feedback for actions like 'saving' or 'undoing' be visually represented?

Left Side Panel (Tools & Assets):

List and describe the primary navigation tabs (e.g., Templates, Elements, Text, Uploads, Photos, Backgrounds, Brand Kit, Projects, Draw, Apps).

For each tab, describe the type of content it houses and any search/filter functionalities.

How will users select and interact with assets/options within these tabs (e.g., click, drag-and-drop)?

Contextual Toolbar (Above/Below Canvas):

Explain how the toolbar adapts based on the selected element (text, image, shape).

Detail the specific editing options available for:

Text: Font selection, size, color, bold/italic/underline, alignment, spacing, effects, animation.

Images/Graphics: Filters, effects, cropping, positioning (layering), transparency, rotation, resizing.

Shapes: Color, border, fill, size, rotation.

Design Canvas:

Describe the interactive capabilities of the canvas (e.g., drag-and-drop elements, resize handles, rotation points).

How will alignment guides, snap lines, and rulers assist users in precise placement?

What visual cues indicate selection, hover, or active states of elements?

How will zooming and panning be managed?

User Interaction & Workflow:

Map out step-by-step user flows for key actions, including:

Starting a new design (from template or blank).

Adding, editing, and formatting text.

Adding and manipulating graphic elements (shapes, icons, illustrations).

Uploading and inserting personal media.

Applying effects, filters, or animations to elements.

Saving and exporting the final design.

Emphasize efficiency and ease of use for each flow.

Visual Design & Aesthetic:

Define the color palette for the UI elements (e.g., primary, accent, functional colors for success/error/warning).

Specify the typography for UI labels, menus, and content within the design.

Describe the iconography style (e.g., outlined, filled, minimalist, consistent).

What is the overall aesthetic and brand consistency you aim for (e.g., modern, clean, vibrant, professional)?

Usability & User Experience (UX) Principles:

How will the UI ensure intuitiveness for first-time users?

What measures ensure ease of navigation and discoverability of features?

Describe concrete feedback mechanisms (visual and interactive cues) that confirm user actions, indicate progress, or highlight errors.

How will you handle error states and provide helpful messages?

Accessibility (WCAG 2.x AA Compliance):

Detail considerations for keyboard navigation and focus management.

How will color contrast be ensured for text and interactive elements?

Explain the use of semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for screen readers.

Provide strategies for text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images).

Performance & Technical Considerations:

How will you ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions?

Mention strategies for efficient rendering of complex designs.

Briefly touch upon security aspects relevant to the UI (e.g., data privacy, secure uploads)."
